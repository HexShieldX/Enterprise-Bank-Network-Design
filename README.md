                     **  Bank Network Design with Fully Functional ATM System**

Project: Bank Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer
Author: Arshman Abbas
Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a bank network with multiple floors, a fully functional ATM system, and layered security at all network endpoints. The project is implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer, showcasing real-world banking network architecture and security practices.
The network is designed to be scalable, secure, and operational, simulating both internal banking operations and external ATM connectivity.

**Features**

Multi-floor Bank Layout: Separate network segments for each floor including:
Customer service
Back-office operations
Management offices
Fully Functional ATM System:
Connects to the central banking server
Simulates real ATM transactions (withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry)

**Layered Security:**

Firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) for network protection
VLAN segentation for internal departments
Secure communication between ATMs and servers
Realistic Networking Components:
Switches, routers, and hubs
Servers for banking operations and authentication

**Simulation of Bank Operations:**

Fund transfers
ATM transaction verification
Secure internal communications
Network Design Diagram

**How to Run**

Open the project in Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x.
Power on all devices.
Verify VLANs, ACLs, and inter-floor connectivity.
Test ATM transactions:
Insert card
Enter PIN
Perform deposit/withdrawal/balance inquiry
Observe network traffic and security rules in action.

**Learning Outcomes**

Understanding of bank network architecture
Implementation of VLANs, ACLs, and security layers
Simulation of real-world ATM operations
Hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracer networking tools

**Future Enhancements**

Integration of multi-branch banking network
Real-time monitoring with SNMP or syslog servers
Implementation of redundant links for high availability
Simulating cybersecurity attacks and response
